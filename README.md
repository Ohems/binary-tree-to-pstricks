# Binary tree to PSTricks [WIP]

Binary tree to PSTricks is an application written in C++ that takes in binary trees in JSON format and outputs LaTeX documents where the binary dree is drawn using PSTricks.

 - [PSTricks web page](http://tug.org/PSTricks/main.cgi)
 - [Binary tree algorithm](https://llimllib.github.io/pymag-trees/)

Libraries used:

This application has been developed as an exercise for a course at the Technical University of Tampere
